1. Introduction
***************************************************

On February 21, 2005, Nintendo released their very own video/music player for the Game Boy Advance in the form of a unique cartridge. It was branded the Play-Yan and was designated the product code AGS-006. Sold exclusively in Japan, it handled MP3 audio files as well and MPEG-4 video files. The hardware had a dedicated SD card slot so users could access their own media.


***************************************************
2. General Hardware Information
***************************************************

- Features a normal-sized SD card reader.
- Can handle card capacities up to 2GB, depending on the manufacturer.
- Not compatible with SDHC, SDXC, or SDUC cards.
- Used hardware decoding for media files via an Alpha Mosiac VC01.
- Uploads firmware on boot, and can optionally update with the correct files on an SD card.
- Features a slightly larger than normal cartridge shell.
- Has a 3.5mm audio jack to output sound and bypass the GBA's speakers.
- Could generate video thumbnails and parse some ID3 tags.
- Videos used ASF or MP4 containers with G.726 or AAC as audio codecs, respectively.
- Maximum of 30 frames-per-second for video.
- Came with 13 "Garage Games" built into the ROM, unlockable with special video files.


***************************************************
3. Hardware Registers and I/O
***************************************************

The Play-Yan has a large number of addresses mapped to cartridge ROM that control firmware access, issue playback commands, and retrieve information such as filenames, thumbnails, and other metadata.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardware Registers	| R/W	| Address	| Size		| Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PY_INIT_DATA		| (R)	| 0x9000000	| 8-bit		| Appears to be some kind of data stream.
PY_STAT			| (R)	| 0x9000006	| 8-bit		| Play-Yan Status Register.
UNKNOWN REGISTER 00	| (w)	| 0xB000000 	| 16-bit	| Unknown. Play-Yan mostly writes zero to this register.
UNKNOWN REGISTER 02	| (R/W)	| 0xB000002	| 16-bit	| Unknown. Play-Yan mostly writes zero to this register.
PY_DATA_ADDR		| (R/W)	| 0xB000004	| 16-bit	| Address used to access Play-Yan data.
PY_DATA_MODE		| (R/W)	| 0xB000006	| 16-bit	| Determines data access mode (e.g. firmware read or firmware write).
PY_DATA_PARAM		| (R/W)	| 0xB000010	| 16-bit	| Appears to be some kind of parameter for data access.
PY_FIRM_STAT		| (R/W)	| 0xB000012	| 16-bit	| Play-Yan Firmware Status Register.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PY_INIT_DATA is read a number of times during the initial boot sequence. It appears to be a data stream of unknown purpose.

PY_STAT acts as the overall status register for the Play-Yan. Its primary purpose appears to be checking whether or not firmware is available accessible. Before uploading any portion of firmware during the initial boot sequence, the Play-Yan checks Bit 7 of PY_STAT, which acts as a busy flag for firmware operations. If Bit 7 is set LOW, the firmware is busy, otherwise if Bit 7 is set HIGH, firmware is ready for more data.

PY_DATA_ADDR determines the address used for data operations for Play-Yan related data. It is used in conjunction with the I/O regions listed below as well as PY_DATA_MODE. Depending on the value of PY_DATA_ADDR, different contexts are used to retrieve data from these regions, e.g. it distinguishes between writing commands for the Play-Yan to execute or writing firmware data. The address is actually 32-bits. The Play-Yan must write to PY_DATA_ADDR twice, with the lower 16-bit first, and the upper 16-bit second.

PY_DATA_MODE determines what kind of data read or write the Play-Yan will perform. Used in conjection with the IO regions listed below as well as PY_DATA_ADDR.

PY_DATA_PARAM appears to be a parameter passed along to the Play-Yan that affects data access. Currently unknown exactly how it functions.

PY_FIRM_STAT appears to be another type of firmware status register. Before reading any portion of firmware, the Play-Yan checks this to make sure Bit 4 is set.

Several regions of memory on the Play-Yan are dedicated to unique purposes. Some of them overlap, and their function often depends on whether data is being written or read. The Play-Yan typically uses these for accessing large amounts of information, such as pixels representing video data, firmware, or commands. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I/O Regions		| I/O Direction	| Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0xB000100 - 0xB0002FF	| Input		| Play-Yan Command
0xB000100 - 0xB0002FF	| Input		| Firmware In
0xB000300 - 0xB00031F	| Output	| Game Pak IRQ Data
0xB000300 - 0xB0004FF	| Output	| Play-Yan SD Card and Internal Data
0xB000500 - 0xB0006FF	| Output	| Play-Yan Thumbnail and Video Data
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


***************************************************
4. Reading and Writing Firmware
***************************************************

To write to the Play-Yan's firmware, the following steps are performed:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
PY_DATA_PARAM = 0x0A
PY_DATA_MODE = 0x68
PY_DATA_ADDR = LOW 16 BITS OF ADDRESS
PY_DATA_ADDR = HIGH 16 BITS OF ADDRESS
UNKNOWN REGISTER 02 = 0x00

WAIT FOR BIT 7 OF PY_STAT TO READ HIGH
WRITE DATA INTO 0xB000300 THROUGH 0xB0004FF
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The address to write the firmware is internal to the Play-Yan. This is evidently any address from 0x00000 - 0xEFFFF. Only 512 bytes can be written at a time, so writing the entire firmware to the Play-Yan requires multiple iterations of the above steps.

The Play-Yan provides its own default firmware in its ROM and uploads this accordingly on every boot. This method ensures that the firmware is never corrupted by a bad update. A similar method is used for the WiiSpeak accessory on the Wii. The Play-Yan can update to a newer firmware if such a file is included on the SD card. For the original Play-Yan, the software looks for the file "playan.fup". Nintendo did release at least one firmware update as well, allowing the original Play-Yan to run MP4 files, something the later Play-Yan Micro version could do out-of-the-box.

To read from the Play-Yan's firmware, the following steps are performed:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
PY_DATA_PARAM = 0x08
PY_DATA_MODE = 0x78
PY_DATA_ADDR = LOW 16 BITS OF ADDRESS
PY_DATA_ADDR = HIGH 16 BITS OF ADDRESS
UNKNOWN REGISTER 02 = 0x00
PY_DATA_PARAM = 0x09

WAIT FOR BIT 4 OF PY_FIRM_STAT TO READ HIGH
READ DATA FROM 0xB000300 THROUGH 0xB0004FF
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

It's possible to read sequential blocks of firmware without repeating all of the above steps. The Play-Yan's ROM, for example, reads a total of 0xA00 bytes at a time. After each 0x200 bytes, only PY_FIRM_STAT needs to be checked before reading the next block. Once a total of 0xA00 bytes have been read, however, all the steps mentioned above are repeated before reading sequentially yet again.


***************************************************
5. Reading SD Card Data
***************************************************

The Play-Yan is capable of reading select data from the SD Card. After the software issues a command, the Play-Yan will respond with different kinds of data, for example, a list of all files in a given directory. This means that while the Play-Yan's software does not have direct access to the card, it has a vastly simpler interface to retrieve information. The memory region used overlaps with where firmware is read from, however, the process for accessing is somewhat different. The following steps are performed:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
PY_DATA_PARAM = 0x08
PY_DATA_MODE = 0x78
PY_DATA_ADDR = 0x00
PY_DATA_ADDR = 0x00
UNKNOWN REGISTER 02 = 0x00
PY_DATA_PARAM = 0x09

WAIT FOR BIT 4 OF PY_FIRM_STAT TO READ HIGH
PY_DATA_PARAM = 0x08
READ DATA FROM 0xB000300 THROUGH 0xB0004FF
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As with reading firmware, sequential 512-byte blocks can be read at a time. This is once again achieved by checking PY_FIRM_STAT. An additional step, setting PY_DATA_PARAM to 0x08, however, is necessary. The Play-Yan's software does not update the address when sequentially reading SD card data. Typically, the Play-Yan reads around 0x6600 bytes worth of data at a time and later copying that to RAM. Such a large amount of data allows it to process long lists of filenames, video frames, or vast amounts of metadata, depending on the expected response to a command.


***************************************************
6. Play-Yan Commands
***************************************************

A number of commands may be issued to the Play-Yan. These allow the software to access many of the cartridge's advanced functions surrounding multimedia playback and file handling. Rather than manually processing things, the Play-Yan hands things over to its hardware and firmware through an interface. Each command typically consists of a series of 12 bytes written to the 0xB000100 - 0xB00011F address range. Some commands may contain additional parameter data beyond this, and not every command follows the same pattern of using 32-bit parameters. In general, however, the structure of a command is as follows:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Address			| Data
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
0xB000100 - 0xB000103	| Command 
0xB000104 - 0xB000107	| Parameter 1
0xB000108 - 0xB00010B	| Parameter 2
0xB00010C ...		| Parameter 3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Data for most commands is usually broken into 32-bit chunks, sent LSB first. Essentially, the Play-Yan just sends a command along with 2 parameters, both of which are optional. Below is a list of known or observed commands along with their parameters:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Command					| Parameter 1							| Parameter 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0x200 - Get File Information		| N/A								| N/A
0x300 - Adjust Video Brightness		| Brightness level, Min = 0x101, Max = 0x2C0, 0x40 increments	| N/A
0x500 - Grab Video Thumbnail Data*	| Width of thumbnail (60 pixels)				| Height of thumbnail (40 pixels)
0x600 - Unknown				| N/A								| N/A
0x700 - Play Video/Grab Video Frame*	| Width of video (240 pixels)					| Height of video (160 pixels)
0x701 - Stop Video Playback		| N/A								| N/A
0x600 - Play Music File*		| Music Filename						| N/A
0x801 - Stop Music Playback		| N/A								| N/A
0x902 - Pause Music/Video Playback	| N/A								| N/A
0x904 - Resume Music/Video Playback	| N/A								| N/A
0xB00 - Adjust Volume			| Volume level, Min = 0x00, Max = 0x38				| N/A
0xD00 - Adjust Bass Boost		| Bass boost level, Min = 0x00, Max = 0x0F			| N/A
0xD01 - Enabled/Disable Bass Boost	| ON = 0x800F, OFF = 0x8F0F					| N/A
0x2000 - Update File Information	| N/A								| N/A
0x8000 - Get SD Card Status		| N/A								| N/A
0x10000 - Enter Sleep Mode		| N/A								| N/A
0x800000 - Unknown			| N/A								| N/A
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*These commands send non-standard amounts of data for their parameters. See the end of this sectiond for further details on each. additional data beyond a second parameter. Overall, it sends a total of 0x218 bytes, the latter portion of which has an unknown purpose.

The following proceedure is used to issue commands:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
PY_DATA_MODE = 0x68
PY_DATA_ADDR = 0xF020
PY_DATA_ADDR = 0x000F
UNKNOWN REGISTER 02 = 0x00

WAIT FOR BIT 7 OF PY_STAT TO READ HIGH
WRITE DATA INTO 0xB000100 THROUGH 0xB00010B
PY_DATA_PARAM = 0x0C
PY_DATA_PARAM = 0x08
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the data address specified by PY_DATA_ADDR is 0xFF020. Some commands will trigger a Game Pak IRQ when the Play-Yan responds. See the section below for more details.

The 0x500 Grab Video Thumbnail Data command sends additional unknown data via Parameter 3. Altogether, 0x218 bytes are sent. Since this amount exceeds the 0xB0002FF boundary for parameter input, the last 0x18 bytes are written at the beginning of the section, starting over at 0xB000100.

The 0x600 Play Music File command uses Parameter 1 as a null-terminated string representing the filename of specific music file to play. The Play-Yan software internally keeps track of which song the user has currently highlighted, and it passes the filename's string to the hardware. The string has no fixed length, thus making this an irregular command. The Play-Yan appears to send additional unknown data after the string.

The 0x700 Play Video command uses Parameter 3 as a null-terminated string representing the filename of a specific video file to play. Like music, the Play-Yan software internally monitors which video the user has highlighted and passes the filename's string to the hardware. This string likewise has no fixed length. The Play-Yan appears to send additional unknown data after the string.


***************************************************
7. Game Pak IRQs
***************************************************

The Play-Yan's hardware produces a variety of Game Pak IRQs when the software sends certain commands. Not every command will generate an IRQ, however, the ones that do are pivotal to operating the Play-Yan. For example, during the initial boot process, the Play-Yan's software waits indefinitely until several commands to respond with IRQs, without which the software essentially locks up. Each Game Pak IRQ returns data that can be read at 0xB000300 - 0xB00031F. Some commands may cause multiple IRQs to be generated as well. Use the following process to read the Game Pak IRQ data:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
PY_DATA_PARAM = 0x08
PY_DATA_MODE = 0x78
PY_DATA_ADDR = 0xF000
PY_DATA_ADDR = 0x000F
UNKNOWN REGISTER 02 = 0x00
PY_DATA_PARAM = 0x09

WAIT FOR BIT 4 OF PY_FIRM_STAT TO READ HIGH
PY_DATA_PARAM = 0x08
READ DATA FROM 0xB000300 THROUGH 0xB00031F
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A list of commands and their known IRQs and the IRQ data is shown below:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Command 0x200 - Get File Information - 3 IRQs*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bytes 0x00 - 0x03	| 0x80000100 or 0x80001000
Bytes 0x04 - 0x07	| 0x00
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bytes 0x00 - 0x03	| 0x40000200
Bytes 0x04 - 0x07	| Unknown
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bytes 0x00 - 0x03	| 0x40000201
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This command prompts the Play-Yan to start reading the filesystem on the SD card. It allows the software to grab a list of available files or folders for music, or video files. This apparently needs to be used in conjunction with the 0x2000 command, which is responsible for accessing multimedia files. Prior to executing the 0x2000 command, the 0x200 command seems to be reading some kind of data from the File Allocation Table, e.g. strings like "System Volume Information".

The first 32-bit value in the first IRQ differs based on context. During the initial boot section, 0x80000100 is used. It is also used when entering or exiting the video menu. For entering and exiting the music menu, however, the value 0x80001000 is used.

*The last two IRQs are generated multiple times during the boot process, before the 0x2000 is executed.





-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Command 0x500 - Grab Video Thumbnail Data - 1 IRQ
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bytes 0x00 - 0x03	| 0x40000500
Bytes 0x04 - 0x07	| Unknown
Bytes 0x08 - 0x0B	| Unknown
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

After the 0x500 command is issued, a corresponding Game Pak IRQ signals that the Play-Yan is ready to provide a 60x40 thumbnail image for a video file. For the specifics regarding reading these thumbnails, refer to the appropiate section below.





-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Command 0x600 - Unknown - 1 IRQ
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bytes 0x00 - 0x03	| 0x40000600
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of the command remains unknown. It always precedes the 0x800 command when playing music. Note, however, that it does not appear when playing videos.





-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Command 0x700 - Play Video/Grab Video Frame - 2 IRQs*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bytes 0x00 - 0x03	| 0x40000700
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bytes 0x00 - 0x03	| 0x80001000
Bytes 0x04 - 0x07	| Video Length Counter
Bytes 0x08 - 0x0B	| Frame Size in Bytes
Bytes 0x14 - 0x18	| Current Video Position
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

These interrupts are responsible for alerting the Play-Yan's software when a new video frame is ready for display, as well as the current position within a video as it is playing. The first IRQ initializes the process, while the second IRQ repeats indefinitely until the end of the video.

Each time the second IRQ is fired, the Current Video Position is updated. The Play-Yan software uses this to determine the minutes/seconds timestamp. It appears that the value 0x3C0 roughly equates 1 second. This IRQ fires every time a video frame needs to be displayed, therefore it should match the video's framerate. Each increment of the Current Video Position should thus reflect that. E.g. for a video playing at 30 frames-per-second, the Current Video Position updates at roughly 0x20 intervals.

The frame itself is read similarly to video thumbnails. Refers to the appropiate section below for more details. The size of the frame is the video's resolution (typically 240x160) in 15-bit color pixels. Therefore, this value is usually 0x12C00.

*The second IRQ constantly fires for the duration of the video for as many frames need to be updated each second.





-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Command 0x701 - Stop Video Playback - 2 IRQs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bytes 0x00 - 0x03	| 0x40000701
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bytes 0x00 - 0x03	| 0x80001000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Stops the current video file that is playing.





-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Command 0x800 - Play Music File - 2 IRQs*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bytes 0x00 - 0x03	| 0x40000800
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bytes 0x00 - 0x03	| 0x80001000
Bytes 0x0C - 0x0F	| Unknown
Bytes 0x10 - 0x13	| Unknown
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

After the 0x800 command is issued, a Game Pak IRQ is generated when the Play-Yan hardware begins processing an audio file. This command always follows the 0x600 command.

*The second IRQ constantly fires for the duration of the music.





-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Command 0x801 - Stop Music Playback - 2 IRQs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bytes 0x00 - 0x03	| 0x40000801
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bytes 0x00 - 0x03	| 0x80001000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Stops the current music file that is playing.





-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Command 0x2000 - Update File Information - 1 IRQ
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bytes 0x00 - 0x03	| 0x80000100
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Only 1 IRQ is fired for this command. It appears to update the current list of available files for videos, and files and folders for music. After executing this command, SD card data will return the appropiate files depending on the category selected.





-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Command 0x8000 - Get SD Card Status - 2 IRQs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bytes 0x00 - 0x03	| 0x80000100
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bytes 0x00 - 0x03	| 0x40008000
Bytes 0x04 - 0x07	| SD Card Status
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A single value is returned for the SD card's status. This can be used to determine if an appropiate SD card has been inserted. As the SD card is essential for the Play-Yan, this is the first command executed when booting. The status is returned in the second IRQ. If no SD card is detected, this value reads 0x03. If an incompatible card is detected (such as an SDHC card), this value reads 0x02. If a compatible card is detected, this value reads 0x05.





-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Command 0x800000 - Unknown - 1 IRQ
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bytes 0x00 - 0x03	| 0x40800000
Bytes 0x04 - 0x07	| SD Card Status
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This command is issued shortly after Get SD Card Status. It's purpose is currently unknown. It generates 1 IRQ, which also returns the card's status.


***************************************************
8. Reading Video Frames and Video Thumbnails
***************************************************

Use the following process to read video frame or video thumbnail data after issuing the 0x500 or the 0x700 command:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
PY_DATA_PARAM = 0x08
PY_DATA_MODE = 0x78
PY_DATA_ADDR = 0x0000
PY_DATA_ADDR = 0x0000
UNKNOWN REGISTER 02 = 0x00
PY_DATA_PARAM = 0x09

WAIT FOR BIT 4 OF PY_FIRM_STAT TO READ HIGH
READ DATA FROM 0xB000500 THROUGH 0xB0006FF
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Data can be read sequentially in 512-byte blocks without the need for writing to other registers. Simply waiting for Bit 4 of PY_FIRM_STAT is sufficient. Each frame or thumbnail will be the size as specified by the 0x500 or the 0x700 command, which ordinarily is 60x40 and 240x160, respectively. Both use 15-bit pixels, and their format is an exact match for the Game Boy Advance's bitmap mode (BG Mode 3). In total, the Play-Yan will typically provide 0x12C0 bytes of data for each thumbnail and 0x12C00 for each video frame.

A 0x500 command must be issued for each thumbnail the Play-Yan needs to process. Each page in the Play-Yan's file browser can only contain 6 videos, therefore, the Play-Yan's software only issues 6 of these commands at a time. If a page has less than 6 entries, only that many 0x500 commands need to be sent. It seems a 0x2000 command is always issued before the first 0x500 command; this may be the mechanism that tells the Play-Yan which videos need thumbnails generated.

For video frames, the 0x700 command is only issued once. Subsequent Game Pak IRQs are automatically generated by the video processing hardware for each frame, at which point the Play-Yan can read back this data and display them using BG Mode 3 for fullscreen bitmap display.


***************************************************
9. Garage Games
***************************************************

The original Play-Yan allowed users to access 13 minigames called "Garage Games". After the Play-Yan launched, Nintendo released them on their website in a weekly fashion. Users downloaded a special .ASF file, and when stored on an SD card, the Play-Yan would start the game. The entire game took place in the 60x40 window dedicated to video thumbnails. Contrary to most available information, these Garage Games are technically not "DLC". Each Garage Game already exists in the Play-Yan ROM and the .ASF files contain no executable code. However, the Garage Games are normally inaccessible without the .ASF files present. The files Nintendo provided act as a sort of key that unlocks the content.

Each .ASF file is a valid video and will generate a thumbnail preview on the Play-Yan. This thumbnail acts as a fingerprint that the Play-Yan can use to identify an individual file. The 0x12C0 bytes of thumbnail data is quickly hashed into a 32-bit number and compared against a list of expected values. Should the thumbnail's hash match that internal list, the Play-Yan recognizes it as a Garage Game.

It should also be noted that the video file's name has to match as well. If the file name is incorrect, the Play-Yan won't bother creating a hash and will simply treat it as a regular video file. This behavior can be reproduced by renaming any of the .ASF files from Nintendo. The names of each Garage Game is case-sensitive as well; they all need to be uppercase in order to work. A list of all the Garage Games and their 32-bit hashes is provided below:

AVOID		0xF8CB9008
BAT		0xD911FE57
CREDIT		0x02F86041
FIRE		0x0D78A9FE
FISH		0x5741DE47
INSECT		0x4D5E5AEB
JUMP		0x748C5BAF
KEEPER		0x3FEBEFE5
MEMORY		0x90119AE6
NEKOROID	0xD839D809
NOSE		0x86D3BA78
TRIPLE		0xD5C0A40B
WAVE		0xE7DCD82B

The hash can be calculated using the following psuedo-code:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
HASH = 0
INDEX = 0

WHILE INDEX NOT EQUAL TO 0x960
	HASH = HASH + 16-BIT THUMBNAIL PIXEL DATA
	HASH = HASH ROTATE RIGHT 31
	INCREMENT INDEX BY 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Although this hashing prevents most ordinary videos from randomly generating a thumbnail that triggers the Garage Game to play, the hashing method is prone to collisions. It is possible, therefore, to specifically create a thumbnail that matches any of the above listed hashes, in effect creating "bootleg" Garage Games.
